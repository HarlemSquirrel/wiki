While Kafka is not a message queue, it has certain features that make it a great fit for Active Job, especially when strict ordering and scaling are desired.

Enhanced Active Job adapter provides extra capabilities to regular Active Job to elevate the combination of Active Job and Kafka.

## Enabling Enhanced Active Job

No action needs to be taken. Please follow the [Active Job setup](Active-Job#active-job-setup) instructions, and the moment you enable Karafka Pro, it will use the Enhanced Active Job components.
