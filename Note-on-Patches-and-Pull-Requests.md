Fork the project.
Make your feature addition or bug fix.
Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
Commit, do not mess with Rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull). Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

Each pull request must pass our quality requirements. To check if everything is as it should be, we use [PolishGeeks Dev Tools](https://github.com/polishgeeks/polishgeeks-dev-tools) that combine multiple linters and code analyzers. Please run:

```bash
bundle exec rake
```

to check if everything is in order. After that you can submit a pull request.
