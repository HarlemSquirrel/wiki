Custom interchangers target issues with non-standard (binary, etc.) data that we want to store when we do #perform_async. This data might be corrupted when fetched in a worker (see [this](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/issues/30) issue). With custom interchangers, you can encode/compress data before it is being passed to scheduling and decode/decompress it when it gets into the worker.

**Warning**: if you decide to use slow interchangers, they might significantly slow down Karafka.

```ruby
class Base64Interchanger
  class << self
    def load(params)
      Base64.encode64(Marshal.dump(params))
    end

    def parse(params)
      Marshal.load(Base64.decode64(params))
    end
  end
end
