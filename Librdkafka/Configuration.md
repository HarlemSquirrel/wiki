# Librdkafka Configuration Properties

!!! note ""

    This page is a copy of the [CONFIGURATION.md](https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md) of `librdkafka`. 

    This page has been made full-screen to ease navigation.

The configuration values below fall under the `kafka` scope within WaterDrop and Karafka. Aside from these, both frameworks have multiple root configuration options that dictate their overall behavior. Ensure you differentiate between kafka-specific settings and the broader root configurations for effective setup and adjustments.
