When deciding between Karafka Pro and Enterprise, it's vital to understand that the technical features of the Karafka ecosystem remain the same across both. The primary distinctions lie not in the technical functionality but in licensing, usage permissions, payment methods, and support for compliance documentation. For larger organizations that prioritize legal compliance and aim to minimize any legal impact of using third-party software, the Enterprise license agreement is tailored to meet such needs.

Additionally, the offline/embedded mode available in the Enterprise version is specifically designed to reduce the supply chain footprint. This can be especially crucial for organizations subject to rigorous security checks and compliance requirements.

## Key Differences between Karafka Pro and Enterprise

1. **Extended Contingent Rights**: With the Enterprise version, organizations have the privilege to continue using the version of Karafka available on the day their license expires or subscription terminates. This means that even if you decide not to renew or end your subscription, you can still legally use the existing version without any subsequent updates.

2. **Offline / Embedded Usage Rights**: Enterprise users are not tied to our gem server for license gem download and verification. This grants organizations the flexibility and independence to utilize Karafka without any external dependencies.

3. **Private Fork Usage**: One of the standout features of the Enterprise version is the extended permission granted to users. You can continue using your private fork of Karafka even after your license expires or your subscription concludes. This ensures that your operations remain unaffected, granting you more control over your ecosystem.

4. **Flexible Payment Options**: Understanding the diverse needs of large organizations, the Enterprise version offers the option of making payments via invoicing. This makes the financial transaction process more streamlined and adaptable to corporate financial workflows.

5. **Compliance Documentation Support**: Legal compliance, especially in today's complex regulatory environment, is paramount. With the Enterprise version, I am available to assist your organization in crafting any security or compliance documentation. This bespoke service ensures that your usage of Karafka aligns with industry standards and meets organizational requirements.

6. **Custom License Agreement**: While Karafka Pro is sold with its set terms and conditions, Enterprise customers may request contract changes. Recognizing that enterprise businesses might have specific requirements or concerns, we offer the flexibility for Enterprise users to request changes to the terms and conditions of the license agreement. This level of customization ensures that your organization's unique needs and preferences are met.
