# Swarm / Multi Process Mode

## Introduction

Karafka's Swarm Mode allows for the efficient CPU-intensive processing of Kafka messages in Ruby. It circumvents Ruby's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitations by utilizing a multi-process architecture, allowing for parallel execution similar to libraries like Puma and Sidekiq Enterprise. This mode is particularly beneficial for CPU-intensive workloads, leveraging Ruby's Copy-On-Write (CoW) feature for memory efficiency. While Karafka's multi-threading excels in I/O-bound tasks, Swarm Mode offers a superior alternative for tasks demanding significant CPU resources, providing scalable and high-performance message processing capabilities.

### Overview of Karafka Swarm Mode

Karafka's Swarm Mode is based on the "Supervisor-Worker" architectural pattern. It utilizes a controller process for supervision and multiple independent child processes for parallel execution. This setup enhances Kafka message processing for CPU-intensive tasks by leveraging multi-process execution. Each child process periodically reports its status to the supervisory master, ensuring system health and efficiency.
