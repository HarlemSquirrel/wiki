## Starting with the example app

If you want to get started with Kafka and Karafka as fast as possible, then the best idea is to just clone our example repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karafka/karafka-example-app ./example_app
```

then, just bundle install all the dependencies:

```bash
cd ./example_app
bundle install
```

and follow the instructions from the [example app Wiki](https://github.com/karafka/karafka-example-app/blob/master/README.md).

**Note**: you need to ensure, that you have Kafka up and running and you need to configure Kafka seed_brokers in the ```app.rb``` file.
