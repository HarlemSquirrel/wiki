### Does Karafka require Ruby on Rails?

**No**. Karafka is a fully independent framework that can operate in a standalone mode. It can be easily integrated with any Ruby-based application, including those written with Ruby on Rails. For more details, please follow the [Integrating with Ruby on Rails and other frameworks](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Integrating-with-Ruby-on-Rails-and-other-frameworks) Wiki section.

### Why there used to be an ApplicationController mentioned in the Wiki and some articles?

You can name the main application consumer with any name. You can even call it ```ApplicationController``` or anything else you want. Karafka will sort that out, as long as your root application consumer inherits from the ```Karafka::BaseConsumer```. It's not related to Ruby on Rails controllers. Karafka framework used to use the ```*Controller``` naming convention up until Karafka 1.2 where it was changed because many people had problems with name colisions.

### Does Karafka require Redis and/or Sidekiq to work?

**No**. Karafka is a standalone framework, with an additional process that will be used to consume Kafka messages.

### Could an HTTP controller also consume a fetched message through the Karafka router?

**No**. Kafka messages can be consumed only using Karafka consumers. You cannot use your Ruby on Rails HTTP consumers to consume Kafka messages, as Karafka is **not** an HTTP Kafka proxy. Karafka uses Kafka API for messages consumption.

### Does Karafka require a separate process running?

**Yes**. Karafka  requires a separate process to be running (Karafka server) to consume and process messages. You can read about it in the [Consuming messages](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Consuming-messages) section of the Wiki.

### Can I start Karafka process with only particular consumer groups running for given topics?

Yes. Karafka allows you to listen with a single consumer group on multiple topics, which means that you can tune up the number of threads that Karafka server runs, accordingly to your needs. You can also run multiple Karafka instances, specifying consumer groups that should be running per each process using the ```--consumer_groups``` server flag as follows:

```bash
bundle exec karafka server --consumer_groups group_name1 group_name3
```

### Can I use ```#seek``` to start processing topics partition from a certain point?

Karafka has a ```#seek``` consumer method that can be used to do that.

### Why Karafka does not pre-initializes consumers prior to first message from a given topic being received?

Because Karafka does not have knowledge about the whole topology of a given Kafka cluster. We work on what we receive dynamically building consumers when it is required.

### Why Karafka does not restart dead PG connections?

This is expected behavior because Karafka is meant to be a transaction supporting system for long-living consumers.

Please see [this](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Problems-and-Troubleshooting#why-karafka-does-not-restart-dead-pg-connections) troubleshooting page for a more extensive explanation of this behavior.

### Does Karafka require gems to be thread-safe?

Yes. Karafka uses multiple threads to process data, similar to how Puma or Sidekiq does it. The same rules apply.

### When Karafka is loaded via a railtie in test env, SimpleCov does not track code changes

Karafka hooks with railtie to load `karafka.rb`. Simplecov **needs** to be required [before](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov#getting-started=) any code is loaded.
