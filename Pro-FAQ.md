Karafka Pro is an enhanced version of the Karafka framework, which adds more functionalities and provides additional support options for customers.

## Is there a trial version?

Yes. You can obtain the license key from our [website](https://karafka.io) for free.

This license key is valid for a month for every environment.

The trial license key does **not** grant you our Pro commercial support.

## What is the license?

See [COMM-LICENSE](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/blob/master/LICENSE-COMM) in the root of the Karafka repo.

## How does Pro licensing work?

Every organization running Karafka Pro on its own servers must purchase a subscription. There's no limit to the number of servers or environments used by that organization. Your subscription will automatically renew every year.

## What happens if my subscription lapses?

If we cannot charge your card, we will email you and try three more times over a week. If it still fails, your subscription will be canceled.

Without a new valid license key, you'll lose access to the priority support, and Karafka Pro won't work anymore.

## Do I need to replace the license key for my running processes?

No. The production environment that is already started will not be affected (until the next deployment).

## How do I buy Karafka Pro?

Just go to our [website](https://karafka.io) and follow the instructions.

## Can I distribute Karafka Pro to my customers?

This is a common requirement for "on-site installs" or "appliances" sold to large corporations.

The standard license is only appropriate for SaaS usage as it does **not** allow distribution. Karafka Pro has an Appliance license option which does allow you to distribute it. The Appliance license is $2,995/yr. It allows you to distribute the Pro gem as part of your application and each of your customers to run Karafka Pro as part of your application only. Email contact@karafka.io to purchase.

## Can you transfer a license?

Licenses are **not** transferrable to another company. It is strongly recommended that you buy the license using a group email address so the license is not attached to any one employee's email address.

## Do I have to share the license key with all of my developers?

In general, yes. A license key is required to get access to all the Pro features. You can use dotenv to load the unencrypted license key in .env into each process, or you can use blackbox or chamber to manage encrypted license key. But the result should always be the same: set an environment variable for Karafka to use when it needs to check the license.

## Can I get a refund?

**No**. We offer a monthly trial during which you can check out Karafka Pro capabilities.

## Ethics, Privacy, and Information Usage

We only collect enough customer information to fill out a standard invoice for billing purposes. Customer information is never shared or sold to anyone.

The Karafka software runs on your servers. Karafka never has access to any private user data.
