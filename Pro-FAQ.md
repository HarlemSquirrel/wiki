Karafka Pro is an enhanced version of the Karafka framework, adding more functionalities and providing additional customer support options.

## Is there a trial version?

Yes. For free, you can obtain temporary credentials from our [website](https://karafka.io/#become-pro).

Those credentials will be valid for a month for every environment.

The trial license does **not** grant you our Pro commercial support.

## What is the license?

See [COMM-LICENSE](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/blob/master/LICENSE-COMM) in the root of the Karafka repo.

## How does Pro licensing work?

Every organization running Karafka Pro on its servers must purchase a subscription. There's no limit to the number of servers or environments used by that organization. Your subscription will automatically renew every year.

## Do I require to change source of the package?

**No**. All Karafka Pro code is stored in the same package and only included and used with a valid license key. You do not have to make any changes to your `Gemfile` setup to use Karafka Pro.

## What happens if my subscription lapses?

If we cannot charge your card, we will email you and try three more times over a week. If it still fails, your subscription will be canceled.

You'll lose access to the gem server, priority support, and Karafka Pro won't work anymore.

## Do I need to replace the license for my running processes?

No. The production environment that is already started will not be affected (until the next deployment).

## How do I buy Karafka Pro?

Just go to our [website](https://karafka.io) and follow the instructions.

## Can I distribute Karafka Pro to my customers?

This is a common requirement for "on-site installs" or "appliances" sold to large corporations.

The standard license is only appropriate for SaaS usage as it does **not** allow distribution. Karafka Pro has an Appliance license option which does allow you to distribute it. The Appliance license is $2,995/yr. It allows you to distribute the Pro gem as part of your application and each of your customers to run Karafka Pro as part of your application only. Email contact@karafka.io to purchase.

## Can you transfer a license?

Licenses are **not** transferrable to another company. It is strongly recommended that you buy the license using a group email address so the license is not attached to any one employee's email address.

## Do I have to share the credentials with all of my developers?

In general, **yes**. The credentials are required to download the gems and your developers will need the gems to use the commercial features.

## Can I get a refund?

**No**. We offer a monthly trial during which you can check out Karafka Pro capabilities.

## Can I accidentally use Pro because it is in the same repository?

**No**. The Pro code is **never** loaded unless a valid `karafka-license` is detected.

## Ethics, Privacy, and Information Usage

We only collect enough customer information to fill out a standard invoice for billing purposes. Customer information is never shared or sold to anyone.

The Karafka software runs on your servers. Karafka never has access to any private user data.
