Karafka Web UI contains several features allowing you to understand your system's karafka consumption process.

Below you can find a comprehensive description of the most important features you can use.

## Consumers

The consumers status view allows users to view and monitor the performance of Kafka-running consumers. The page displays real-time data and aggregated metrics about the status of the consumers, such as their current offset, lag, the current state of consumers, and others.

Users can also view detailed information about each consumer, such as its assigned partitions, group id, and others.

**Note**: Some of the metrics are available only in our Pro offering.
