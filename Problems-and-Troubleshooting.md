# Help!

Read below for tips.  If you still need help, you can:

* Ask your question in [The Karafka official Slack channel](https://slack.karafka.io)
* [Open a GitHub issue](../issues/new).  (Don't be afraid to open an issue, even if it's not a Karafka bug.  An issue is just a conversation, not an accusation!)
* Check our [FAQ](FAQ) and the [Pro FAQ](Pro-FAQ)

You **should not** email any Karafka committer privately.

Please respect our time and efforts by sticking to one of the options above.

For additional priority Pro support and extra features, please consider buying the Pro subscription.
