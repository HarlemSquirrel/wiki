# Upgrading to Karafka 2.3

As always, please make sure you have upgraded to the most recent version of `2.2` before upgrading to `2.3`.

Also, remember to read and apply our standard [upgrade procedures](https://karafka.io/docs/Upgrading/).

## Web UI Upgrade

Karafka `2.3` works only with Web UI `>= 0.8.0`. Please follow the standard Web UI upgrade procedure.

## Shutdown Procedure Updates

Thanks to recent advancements in `librdkafka` and `rdkafka-ruby`, shutdown patches needed in previous versions were removed in `2.3,`, and the whole shutdown procedure has been improved. While we saw only performance and stability improvements in those areas, we would like to highlight this change.

## Potential CLI Inclusions/Exclusions Inconsistency Fix

While this change has already been introduced in `2.2` as a fix, we wanted to make you aware that all the CLI inclusion and exclusion options, such as `--include-consumer-groups` or `--exclude-consumer-groups` expect a list of arguments separated by a **comma** and **NOT** by space:

**BAD**:

```bash
# Wrong, topics separated with a space
bundle exec karafka server --exclude-topics topic1 topic2
```

**GOOD**:

```bash
# Good, topics separated with a comma
bundle exec karafka server --exclude-topics topic1,topic2
```

This change is a regression introduced because of the removal of the Thor gem.
