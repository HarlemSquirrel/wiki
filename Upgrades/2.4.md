# Upgrading to Karafka 2.4

!!! tip "Pro & Enterprise Upgrade Support"

    If you're gearing up to upgrade to the latest Karafka version and are a Pro or Enterprise user, remember you've got a dedicated lifeline! Reach out via the dedicated Slack channel for direct support to ensure everything has been covered.

As always, please make sure you have upgraded to the most recent version of `2.3` before upgrading to `2.4`.

Also, remember to read and apply our standard [upgrade procedures](https://karafka.io/docs/Upgrading/).

## WaterDrop 2.7 Configuration Alignments

Karafka `2.4` relies on WaterDrop `2.7`. If you are upgrading from an earlier WaterDrop version, please make sure to read [WaterDrop changes](https://github.com/karafka/waterdrop/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Consumer Mapper Concept Removal

Karafka used to have a default strategy for building consumer group names. Each consumer group combined `client_id` and the group name taken from the routing.

Below, you can find how Karafka pre `2.4` would remap the following routing:

```ruby
class KarafkaApp < Karafka::App
  setup do |config|
    # ...
    config.client_id = 'my-app'
  end

  routes.draw do
    topic :example do
      consumer ExampleConsumer
    end

    topic :example2 do
      consumer Example2Consumer
    end

    consumer_group :special do
      topic :super_topic do
        consumer Example2Consumer
      end
    end
  end
end

Karafka::Web.enable!
```

The above setup would create three consumer groups:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Group Name</th>
    <th>Topics</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>my-app_app</td>
    <td>example, example2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>my-app_special</td>
    <td>special</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>my-app_karafka_web</td>
    <td>Web UI related topics</td>
  </tr>
</table>


The decision to retire the default consumer group naming strategy in Karafka was driven by a need to address several issues and simplify the system for users, especially as the framework has evolved. Here's a clear and logical explanation of the reasons behind this change:

- The strategy was initially beneficial for setups involving multiple applications and tenants using Kafka, facilitating easier management and segregating consumer groups.

- However, as Karafka expanded, this approach led to complications in various areas, such as the Pro Iterator, Admin features, and the development of new streaming capabilities.

- Newcomers to Karafka, or those migrating from other frameworks, needed clarification, highlighting a need for a more straightforward approach.

- A fundamental assumption made early in the development - that consumer group mapping would only occur from Karafka to Kafka - needed to be updated. As the framework grew, the interaction between Karafka and Kafka became bidirectional, with Karafka also receiving consumer group information from Kafka. This raised several questions:

    * Whether and how to implement reverse mapping for consumer groups.

    * The feasibility and user responsibility in providing a reverse mapper or direct mapping.

    * Ensuring comprehensive coverage of all areas requiring mapping and remapping.

- Reports of inconsistent behavior and bugs related to consumer group mapping started emerging, underscoring the need to revise the strategy.

- The challenges became particularly apparent while enhancing `Karafka::Admin` with `#read_lags` for advanced consumer group management, reinforcing the view that the existing mapping functionality was more problematic than beneficial.

Given these considerations, the decision to retire the consumer mapper concept was made to streamline Karafka's architecture, enhance clarity and usability, and mitigate issues stemming from the outdated one-way mapping assumption.

!!! Warning "Custom Mapper Naming Strategy Alignment"

    If you've used a custom mapper, align your naming to match the new setup according to your mapper behavior.

Below are details about the upgrade path specific to your usage patterns.

### Removal of Custom Mappers

In addition to the changes mentioned below for upgrading to Karafka 2.4, you need to remove the custom mapper configuration from your setup, as it's no longer supported. Specifically, delete the `config.consumer_mapper` line from your `karafka.rb` configuration:

```ruby
class KarafkaApp < Karafka::App
  setup do |config|
    # ...
    #
    # Remove the following line as it's not supported in 2.4+
    config.consumer_mapper = MyCustomConsumerMapper.new
  end
end
```

### Aligning the Simple Routing

When working without explicit consumer groups, all you need to do is alter the `group_id` setting to prefix it with the `client_id` value:

```ruby
class KarafkaApp < Karafka::App
  setup do |config|
    # ...
    config.client_id = 'my-app'
    # `app` without anything used to be the default name in the simple routing
    config.group_id = 'my-app_app'
  end

  # Simple routing is a routing without `consumer_group` bloks
  routes.draw do
    topic :topic1 do
      consumer EventsConsumer
    end

    topic :topic2 do
      consumer WebhooksConsumer
    end
  end
end
```

### Aligning the Multiple Consumer Groups Mode

In the case of the Multiple Consumer Group Mode, you need to update the `group_id` as well as the names of particular consumer groups:

```ruby
class KarafkaApp < Karafka::App
  setup do |config|
    # ...
    config.client_id = 'my-app'
    # `app` without anything used to be the default name in the simple routing
    config.group_id = 'my-app_app'
  end

  # Simple routing is a routing without `consumer_group` bloks
  routes.draw do
    # implicit group topics are covered with the `group_id` update
    topic :topic1 do
      consumer EventsConsumer
    end

    topic :topic2 do
      consumer WebhooksConsumer
    end

    # was: consumer_group do 'group_special' do
    consumer_group do 'my-app_group_special' do
      topic :topic3 do
        consumer SuperConsumer
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Aligning the Admin

Reconfigure Admin to use the extended `group_id` during Karafka configuration:

```ruby
class KarafkaApp < Karafka::App
  setup do |config|
    # ...
    config.client_id = 'my-app'
    config.admin.group_id = 'my-app_karafka_admin'
  end

  routes.draw do
    # ...
  end
end
```

### Aligning the Web UI

Karafka Web UI injects its group, which the mapper also altered. To mitigate it, set the consumer group explicitly:

```ruby
# Put the below before enabling the Web UI

Karafka::Web.setup do |config|
  # Add the prefix matching your client_id merged with the underscore
  config.processing.consumer_group = 'my-app_karafka_web'
end

Karafka::Web.enable!
```

### Aligning the CLI

Karafka CLI commands must be aligned, such as `bundle exec karafka server --exclude-consumer-groups group_name2,group_name3`.

Commands related to topics and subscription groups are not affected.

```bash
# Assuming that client_id is `my-app`

# Replace
bundle exec karafka server --exclude-consumer-groups group_name2,group_name3

# With
bundle exec karafka server --exclude-consumer-groups my-app_group_name2,my-app_group_name3
```
