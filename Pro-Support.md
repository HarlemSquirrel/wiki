Karafka offers community support via [Github issues](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/issues) and a [Slack channel](http://karafka.slack.com/).

Karafka Pro offers priority support via a dedicated per-organization private Slack channel and via email.

## Version Support

## Upgrade Support

While we provide comprehensive [upgrade guides](https://karafka.io/docs/#upgrade-notes) for users to migrate to new versions, it may not be enough, especially when upgrading from unsupported old versions. The upgrade guides offer step-by-step instructions on how to upgrade Karafka, including changes in configuration, code, and dependencies.

However, in some cases, users may be upgrading from versions that are no longer supported or have significant differences in functionality, making the upgrade process more complex. Pro yearly subscribed users may reach out for additional support in such cases.

Upgrading Karafka can be a critical task for maintaining the health and performance of an application, so it's essential to approach the process carefully and with sufficient resources.
